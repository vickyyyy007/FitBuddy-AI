# FitBuddy AI — 8 Phase Project Documentation
FitBuddy — AI Fitness Plan Generator
FitBuddy is a complete FastAPI application based on the supplied project brief. It includes a responsive Jinja2 website, SQLite persistence, seven-day workout plans, nutrition and recovery tips, feedback-based revisions, a coach dashboard, and JSON API endpoints.

The PDF describes the retired Gemini 1.5 Pro / Flash models and the older google-generativeai SDK. This implementation uses Google's current google-genai Python SDK and configurable model names. It starts in local demo mode with no API key, so you can explore the application before connecting Gemini. With no key, the plan and tip come from built-in deterministic examples; with a key, generation goes to Gemini.

FitBuddy offers general fitness information, not medical advice. The generated suggestions are not a substitute for a clinician or qualified fitness professional. Users should stop for pain or concerning symptoms.

Requirements
Python 3.10 or newer (Python 3.11 or 3.12 recommended)
Visual Studio Code
Internet access only to install Python packages and, optionally, call Gemini
A Gemini API key is optional; obtain one from Google AI Studio
Open in VS Code
Extract or copy the FitBuddy folder to a convenient location.
In VS Code, choose File → Open Folder… and select FitBuddy.
Open Terminal → New Terminal. Check Python with python --version.
Run the following in the VS Code terminal (PowerShell on Windows):

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
If PowerShell blocks environment activation, run this once in that terminal and activate again:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
On macOS/Linux, use source .venv/bin/activate in place of the Windows activation line.

Enable live Gemini generation (optional)
Open .env and set your key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_key
The defaults use gemini-3.8-flash for both workout and tip generation. If the model is unavailable for your account, set GEMINI_WORKOUT_MODEL and GEMINI_TIP_MODEL to model IDs enabled for your Gemini API project. The key stays in .env, which is excluded from Git.

Run the app
With the virtual environment active, start from the FitBuddy project folder:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Open:

Website: http://127.0.0.1:8000
Interactive API reference: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Health and mode: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
Stop the local server with Ctrl+C. The SQLite database (fitbuddy.db) is created automatically in the project folder on first run.

VS Code also includes a FitBuddy (Uvicorn) debug launch configuration under Run and Debug.

Try the application
On the home page, enter a name, an ID such as alex_01, age, weight in kg, a goal, and intensity. Submit the form to see a seven-day plan and nutrition/recovery tip.
On the result page, enter feedback such as “make the cardio lower impact” and submit it. The revised plan is saved separately from the original.
To view the coach dashboard, set ADMIN_TOKEN to a private local value in .env, restart the app, and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/view-all-users?token=YOUR_TOKEN. Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the value you set. The API admin routes accept the same value in the X-Admin-Token request header.
In /docs, try GET /api/health, POST /api/plans, POST /api/plans/{user_id}/feedback, and GET /api/plans/{user_id}. For POST /api/plans, use a body like:
{
  "username": "Alex Morgan",
  "user_id": "alex_01",
  "age": 28,
  "weight_kg": 68,
  "goal": "general_wellness",
  "intensity": "medium"
}
Valid goals: weight_loss, muscle_gain, general_wellness, flexibility. Valid intensities: low, medium, high. API errors use standard HTTP error responses and FastAPI validation messages.

Notes
The app is intended for local development. Before any public deployment, use a proper authentication system, secure secrets, HTTPS, request limits, and a managed database. The coach token query parameter is convenient for local use; avoid putting real secrets in URLs in a deployed application.
ALLOW_DEMO_AI=true falls back to a deterministic demo response if Gemini is not configured or temporarily errors. Set it to false when you want generation failures to be shown instead of demo content.
Weight is used as profile context only; FitBuddy does not calculate BMI, calories, or target weight.
Existing profiles are updated when the same user ID is submitted again. Each new generation creates a separate plan record, preserving the previous plan history.
